	What I remember is dad at it again. He did this every time Shifu was late. He made us run around the mats and the whole time he stood there with his arms crossed.
	"Someday you go to the Shaolin Temple," he said. "You see how good you have it. My uncle woke up every day at five am. Sometimes four. Bababa," he says, making mock running motions. "Three hours. Running up and down the mountain. Wearing sandbags. Someday you go and see. You see how easy this is."
	Yun Qi slowed down for breath. She put her hands on her knees. "Yun Qi!" he snapped. "Go!" She started running again and slowed down half a lap later. Now Dad paced, glaring at the punching bag every time he passed it. "You guys don't know," he said. "You guys don't know. You know at the Shaolin Temple there are holes in the ground. Big!" He brandished his arms to show us how big. "Every day they practice. Stomping, stomping, stomping. Hundreds of years. Until there are holes in the ground. In the rock." He went over to Yun Qi and gave her a good shove. "You know that?" he said. "You think this is hard?" And she started to go again but she was stumbling already. Dad grabbed her and looked into her eyes. 
	"What are you doing here?" he said.
	"I . . ."
	Then Dad raised his palm. I don't want to talk about the rest. Shifu never showed up and that's how it went for two hours. Dad and Yun Qi and me and Dad. At least that's what I remember. Maybe you don't trust me and I don't have any marks to prove it, but that's what I remember.
