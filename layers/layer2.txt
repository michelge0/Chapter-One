	The monk smiles at her but she shakes her head. She hasn’t got any tickets, and she doesn’t want to wait the line.
	“Look at that,” John says.
	She looks. A bunch of kids, neon yellow uniforms highlighting them against the dust, have gathered in the courtyard, twirling chains.
	“Hell of an education.”
	“Want to watch?”
	John fans himself with his brochure. “Yeah. We can do that.” He fans himself. “It’s hot.”
	“Hotter for them,” Yun says.
	“You bet. They must have hells of stamina.”
	“They’re probably used to it.”
	“You’re right. They’re probably chilly.”
	She starts to smile.
	“What do you say we go in?”
	“Long line.”
	“It’s cool.”
	“Yeah.”
	“We can always watch these guys.”
	“Might as well.”
	They stand for a while. The kids keep practicing. Some man raises an iPad to his face and records them. They stand some more.
	“Almost there,” he says, looking at his phone. She pokes at an empty noodle cup with her foot. The line churns forward. She looks at the kids again. One of them’s a little off to the side. He’s thinner than the rest, and shorter. He looks bored as he twirls his chain then twirls it back then twirls it around and catches it.
	“Hey Yun?”
	She watches the kids. Years and years, she thinks. She can’t stop. The line’s moving past her.
	“Yun, I need you,” John says. He’s standing at the ticket booth, the woman inside tapping her pen impatiently.
	“Sorry,” she says. “I was just thinking.” She goes up to the woman and starts talking Chinese. They get their tickets and go up into the temple. The show is just starting.
