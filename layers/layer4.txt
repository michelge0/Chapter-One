	One day Stevie Wu shows up again. I haven’t seen him since eighth grade. He’s grown a lot taller since then, taller than me, and he’s shed the acne. He shows up looking razor sharp in this suit with a girl at his side. We look at each other across the threshold.
	“Hey, man,” I say. For a second I can’t find his name.
	“Hello, Vince,” he says. He tips his head forward. “How have you been?”
	“Great.” He’s looking past me, into the room. I shuffle aside. “Come on in.”
	He tells the girl to wait for him. She rolls her eyes.
	“It’s been a while,” I say, moving some old clothes off the couch so he can sit. He stays standing.
	“Yes, Vince. It’s been quite some time.”
	“You, uhh, want some water?”
	“That would be fabulous.”
	I go over to the sink and look around for a cup. Dishes lay around like rubble. Nothing. I slip a plastic one out from the counter, trying to remember what I can about Stevie. Smart. Did his homework. Aced the ACT or something.
	“How’s Yun?” Stevie asks as I hand him the glass. He glances around. “Still in Chinatown?”
	“No. Well, she left. She left some time ago.”
	“Job?”
	“Silicon Valley.” I stand there, watch him take a slow, analytical sip, then set the cup down on the foot table.
	“You know, it’s always struck me how people change,” Stevie says, licking his lips. “I never thought I’d be where I am today.” He looks at me.
	“Yeah,” I say, trying desperately to remember how else I’m supposed to know him. He shifts on the couch. “So what are you doing back here?”
	“I wanted to see you,” he says. He picks at a tear in the couch where most of the fluff’s already spilled out. “And deliver an important message.”
	“Yeah?”
	He leans forward. He gives it a good wait. “Fuck you,” he says. Then he walks out.
