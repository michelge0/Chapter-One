August 9.
	It hasn’t stopped. Had to skip work today b/c friends keep asking. Asked Clara to get me some makeup but not much use. Every time I look in the mirror it’s worse. Yesterday my skin got two shades tanner (comparing to aug. 7 images). It’s like I went to the beach or something. My eyelids are folding & blackening like some kind of rotting avocado. My hair looks burnt at the ends. Don’t know what to do. Boss is phoning like crazy. Haven’t seen kids in days. God. What are kids going to think? Maybe Billy’s young enough to not ask questions but Janet will have nightmares. No choice but to wait until whatever this is stops but I don’t think it’s going to. All night I can feel my whole body itching like there are eggs hatching everywhere under my skin. It crawls and stings & I can’t sleep w/o having nightmares. I don’t know what’s happening to me. Went all the way to pg. 147 of google results & not a thing. Is this magic? God? I don’t believe in either but maybe I need to start.

	Went down to hotel lobby for a smoke & some old guy started talking to me in Japanese or something. Super awkward + didn’t know how to respond. Went back to room & resolved to not come out again until I’m fixed. Hair almost 100% black now. I hate mirrors.

	Clara called. Wants me to go home. Kids are worried sick + asking abt me every day. What am I supposed to tell them? It’s fine, Clara keeps saying. Nobody’s going to care. It’s probably some weird disease or something. Can’t help but feel like she doesn’t get it. <u>It’s not fine.</u> Kids will be horrified. Nobody will know what to think. Hotel bills racking up but if I wait a few more days it’s got to stop. Diseases don’t last forever.
