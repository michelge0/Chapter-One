	“Hot damn.”
	“Oh, shut up.”
	“I was complementing you. That was a complement.”
	“Well thank you.”
	“Sure.”
	“You shake a lot.”
	“Do I?”
	“Was that your first?”
	“Yeah.”
	“. . .”
	“. . .”
	“I’d better get going.”
	“Are they still at it?”
	“Music’s on. Can’t you hear it?”
	“No. Can you?”
	“No. But I can feel the drums.”
	“I guess.”
	“Yeah.”
	“How old are you?”
	“What?”
	“How old are you?”
	“Not that old.”
	“What does that mean?”
	“I’d better get back to my friends.”
	“Wait a little?”
	“What do you want?”
	“You.”
	“Sorry.”
	“Damn. Oh, damn, that’s going to be sore in the morning.”
	“Means you’ve had a good time.”
	“I think I’m drunk.”
	“Never been drunk before?”
	“I’ve been drunk. That’s how I know.”
	“Mhmm.”
	“Am I going to remember you?”
	“Probably not. Aren’t you drunk?”
	“Damn. Just . . .”
	“That’s my favorite song. I’m off.”
	“Hey, what’s your name?”
	She slides a little back into the car, then glances at him. She looks like a fox.
	“Jane,” she says.
	“Nice to meet you, Jane. I’m Vince.”
	She smiles halfway, to one side. Then she steps out into the street. “You might want to pull your pants up.” The door shuts. Vince falls back against the leather of the seat.
