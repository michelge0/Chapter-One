	Yun Qi doesn’t realize until she’s halfway to the Shaolin Temple that she can’t find her passport. She looks in her purse, checks her luggage, empties her purse and puts everything back in. She tells the taximan to go back to the station and runs up and down the platforms, picking through hundreds of churning feet. She finds trash, dust, dust. So many feet kicking everything every which way. Somebody brushes against her and she jostles him back, hard.
	She goes back to the taxi man. The taxi man is smoking.
	Ready?
	Wait a moment.
	She gets out her phone, dials a number, listens to it ring.
	Vince? she says.
	Yeah. It’s me.
	Polluted, she says. As usual. Shitty as fuck.
	No, she says. Look, I need help.
	The taxi man smokes, glances at her, smokes.
	I lost my passport, she says.
	I know, she says. I looked.
	No, she says. Look, it’s not there. Really.
	I know.
	Yeah.
	Can you just ask Dave? Dave’s got to know.
	She leans against the cab, looks out at the station. A train has just docked and the horde is overflowing into the streets.
	I don’t know, she says. It’s not like it’s happened before.
	Yeah. That’d be great.
	Sure.
	Thanks.
	She pauses, glances at the taximan.
	No, she says. Well, yeah. I thought I’d see the temple.
	A longer pause. She listens to the phone.
	I know, she says. Vince, I have vacation days. Relax. I was curious.
	I know he was.
	Vince, please.
	Jesus Christ, can we talk about this some other time?
	Vince—
	Ok, just—
	She lowers the phone. The taximan is watching her. He starts to smile.
	Ready?
	She glances back at the station.
	Go or stay, he says.
	She sighs, and gets into the car.
