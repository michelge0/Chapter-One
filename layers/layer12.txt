	<i>I’ve seen it with my own eyes and alone. During the day the place is just the Padoga Forest. Some tourist dump. Wait until evening when nobody’s around and it’s something else entirely. Watch as the light rises from the stone like water evaporating. The sky pink with evening. Mosquitoes poking you. There’s nothing different about that place but the silence. And the stones. The way they stand, like statues. You stand there and listen to that silence and it dawns on you how old are those buried there and what they did. You hear stories about it all the time. Monks who fought wolves. Monks who trained so hard they wore out dents into the stone and jabbed holes in tree trunks. You see all the Kung Fu movies and you laugh and then you come out and see this and all you can say is nothing. You walk around them and look at them and reach out and touch them. Nobody’s watching you. There are no guards. It’s just an evening, you think, then you start to head back and you turn and you see them. They stand there like statues you know. Except you can’t see their faces. No matter how you look at them you can’t see their faces.
	Me, I went around and around and not once did they turn. No matter what angle, what position, what distance, all I could see were their backs. And I remember thinking right then that if I could just catch a glimpse of their eyes everything would be alright. If they could just cock their necks toward me or glance at me from the corners of their eyes all the things I thought were hopeless would unravel just like that. That was all I needed, I kept thinking. Maybe if their whole faces was too much to ask for, maybe just their ear, or part of it, the tip golden in the light. I stayed there so long and at some point I climbed the fence and started running between them like a loony but even then they wouldn’t turn. They wouldn’t look at me not even once. They just stood there, awake as ever, faces raised away toward the blackening sky.</i>
