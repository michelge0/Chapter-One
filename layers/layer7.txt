	I’ll tell you what I remember. First time I met the Master I was following Vince home from school. We were nine, ten. I’d never been to Chinatown before. Didn’t know what to think. Far as I knew, we were crossing the Pacific Ocean itself. These fat red paper lamps hung at every street corner and every third building was a restaurant. The restaurants weren’t like anything you’ve seen before. Glass turntables, metal tea kettles, cooks pawing at mounds of dough like tigers, threading off clawfuls of noodle. And everywhere not one white guy.
	But that’s not the point. The point is that he took me through this alley and into some crappy building that looked like the rent was about to expire. The windows were so stained you couldn’t see what it was like from outside. But when you went in you knew just like that. You took one look at the mop-fresh mats and the racks of staffs and spears and swords and you knew what this place was for. It was a place for sweat and grime. It was a place for fighting. I went in and Vince was all, “Don’t step on the mats!” but I kept going anyway. I stood in the center of the floor and swept around and that’s when I saw the Master.
	He wore black, that was the first thing I saw, but he didn’t just wear it, he soaked in it. Light from the room behind him smashed against his body and his whole frame was a silhouette. His face must have been made of bricks at some point but they had melted and all that was left were two infantile cheeks. He took huge, desperate breaths, and I remember breathing faster too, because I was scared he’d take up all the air.
	He looked at me, then looked past me at Vince. Vince something in Chinese. The Master laughed. Then he said the only words he ever said to me. He looked at me, panting, and said, “Hello, white boy.” Then he turned and lumbered back into his abode and the door rattled shut. I don’t know. Ask Vince; maybe he’ll tell you something else. But that’s what I remember.
