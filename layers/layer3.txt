	Yun Qi smiles back at him. The monk beckons, angling his hand toward the temple.
	“Have you eaten?” he asks.
	She shakes her head. “Not yet today.”
	“Food inside,” he says. He beckons at a passing family. Yun Qi drifts with the crowd, down a street of dust-slick cobbles. She sits on a bench beside a small thicket of bamboo, watches a sweeper work her way past, a stream of tourists fanning themselves with their brochures, the monk in gray smiling at the passersby. Behind him, a troupe of students practice with chain whips, shouting every so often in rugged sync. It’s morning and the heat has yet to build. She glances at a mother holding her boy’s hand, who glances back. She looks away. She gets up and goes to the monk.
	“Have you eaten?” the monk says, smiling and angling his palm toward the temple stairs.
	“What’s your name?” she says.
	“Me?” the monk looks at her, starts to laugh. “I’m called Xing Xue.”
	“You practice here often?”
	“When I was young.”
	She nods at the kids. “Like them?”
	“Haha. Yes. Like them.”
	“Was it bitter?”
	“Yes. Very bitter.”
	“Very impressive,” she says.
	“Ah,” he says, nodding.
	“Want to have lunch with me?”	
	He looks at her. “I have to watch my students,” he says.
	She smiles. “I’ll leave then.”
	“Bye.”
	“Bye.”
	She goes down the road a little further. She sits on the bench. It’s later, now, and the dragonflies are zipping about. The tourists have thickened. The smell of cooking smoke wanders by.
